# Contribute

If you're interested in adding features, reporting/fixing bugs, or just discussing the future of Tint, this is the place to start.  Please feel free to reach out if you have questions or comments by opening an [issue](https://github.com/yyyc514/Tint/issues).


## Adding new features

If there's a feature you'd like to see that isn't already in-progress or documented, there are two ways you can go about it:

- open an issue for discussion; or
- fork and submit a PR.

Either way is fine, so long as you remember your PR may not be accepted as-is or at all.  If a feature request is reasonable, though, it'll most likely be included one way or another.

Some other things to remember:

- Please respect the project layout and hierarchy, to keep things organized.
- All Python code should be PEP8 compliant with few exceptions (e.g. imports in `__init__.py` files).
- Include docstrings for all classes and functions, unless functionality is obvious at a glance.
- Include descriptions for issues and PRs.

Please be patient, sometimes I like to live my life instead of hacking on my code.  I promise to reply!


# Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please check for an open issue that already captures the problem you've run into.  If it doesn't exist yet, create it!

Please include the following information when filing a bug:

- Sublime Text version number
- What shell you are using
- Console error output
- A description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce, if possible.

If you're interested in tackling a bug, please say so and I can assign it to you.


# Documentation

If you make changes, please remember to update the user documentation to reflect the new behavior.

# Thank You

Thanks to [divmain](https://github.com/divmain/) for a great template for a CONTRIBUTE file.  This file is almost exactly the same as GitSavvy's.
